## Tilde & Caret Shorthand
Node.js' implementation of semver also introduces shorthand ranges: ~ (tilde) and ^ (caret). The general explanation for how these work is:

* Prefixing a single semver version string with the ~ character defines a range of acceptable versions that **include all patch versions** from the one specified up to, but not including, the next minor version. "~1.2.3" can be approximately expanded as ">=1.2.3 <1.3.0".

* Prefixing a single semver version string with the ^ character defines a range of acceptable versions that **include all patch and minor versions** from the ones specified up to, but not including, the next version. So "^1.2.3" can be approximately expanded as ">=1.2.3 <2.0.0".
